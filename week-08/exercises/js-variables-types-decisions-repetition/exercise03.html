     * SWITCH MOD DAY
     * 
     * Given a positive day, assuming that day 1 is Monday, day 2 is Tuesday,
     * ... day 9 is Tuesday (days "wrap"), day 21 is Sunday, etc.
     * 
     * Use a switch statement to print the appropriate day of the week.
     * 
     * You should be able to handle all positive integers.
     * 
     * Examples
     * 1 -> "Monday"
     * 2 -> "Tuesday"
     * 3 -> "Wednesday"
     * 4 -> "Thursday"
     * 5 -> "Friday"
     * 6 -> "Saturday"
     * 7 -> "Sunday"
     * 8 -> "Monday"
     * 9 -> "Tuesday"
     * 10 -> "Wednesday"
     * 11 -> "Thursday"
     * 12 -> "Friday"
     * 13 -> "Saturday"
     * 14 -> "Sunday"
     * 15 -> "Monday"
     * 16 -> "Tuesday"

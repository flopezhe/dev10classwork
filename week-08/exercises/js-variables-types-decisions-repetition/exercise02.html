     * SUMMER CAMP
     * 
     * Campers at summer camp can choose one of three afternoon activities:
     * swimming, archery, or pottery.
     * 
     * Swimmers must use the buddy system. If there's not an even number of swimmers,
     * swimming is canceled and swimmers are reallocated to archery and pottery with
     * the following rules:
     * - add swimmers to the activity with the least participants until numbers are even
     * - then distribute swimmers evenly, starting with pottery first.
     * 
     * If there are an even number of swimmers, everyone gets their preferred activity.
     * 
     * Scenarios         | 01 | 02 | 03 | 04 | 05 | 06 |
     * -------------------------------------------------
     * starting swimmers |  9 |  6 |  5 | 11 | 99 |  3 |
     * starting archers  | 10 | 13 | 20 |  0 |  3 |  3 |
     * starting potters  | 12 | 21 |  5 | 11 |  7 |  3 |
     * final swimmers    |  0 |  6 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
     * final archers     | 15 | 13 | 20 | 11 | 54 |  4 |
     * final potters     | 16 | 21 | 10 | 11 | 55 |  5 |

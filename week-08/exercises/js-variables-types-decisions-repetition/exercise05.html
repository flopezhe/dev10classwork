    /**
     * DOUBLE IT
     * 
     * 1. Write a loop that "doubles" each character in a word.
     * You'll need a new string variable to store the result.
     * 
     * 2. Print the result.
     * 
     * Examples
     * ===============
     * "dog" -> "ddoogg"
     * "what?" -> "wwhhaatt??"
     * "" -> "" (empty string has nothing to double)
     * " " -> "  " (but whitespace should be doubled)
     * "open & shut" -> "ooppeenn  &&  sshhuutt"
     * "Eep" -> "EEeepp"
     */

     * INTERLEAVE
     * 
     * 1. Write a loop to interleave two strings to form a new string.
     * To interleave, during each loop take one character from the first string and add it to the result
     * and take one character from the second string and add it to the result.
     * If there are no more characters available, don't add characters.
     * 
     * 2. Print the result.
     * 
     * Examples
     * "abc", "123" -> "a1b2c3"
     * "cat", "dog" -> "cdaotg"
     * "wonder", "o" -> "woonder"
     * "B", "igstar" -> "Bigstar"
     * "", "huh?" -> "huh?"
     * "wha?", "" -> "wha?"

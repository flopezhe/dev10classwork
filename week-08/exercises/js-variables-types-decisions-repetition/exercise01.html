     * You have three managers: A, B, and C.
     * Occasionally, they ask you to add features to your company software.
     * 
     * Use if/else statements to enforce the following rules:
     * - If all three ask for the feature, print "Feature in progress."
     * - If any two of the three ask, print "Adding feature to schedule."
     * - If only one of the three ask, print "Going to hold off for a bit."
     * - If none of the managers ask, print "Nothing to do..."
